******************
Major Requirements
******************

The following two (2) courses are required by the program:

* :doc:`../courses/comp417`
* :doc:`../courses/comp460`

.. important::

    :doc:`../courses/comp460` has the prereq :doc:`../courses/comp363`.

Either class above can be substituted with another graduate course under the discretion of GPD if students had their equivalent in their undergraduate program.
