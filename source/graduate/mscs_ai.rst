General Electives (12 Credits/4 classes)
****************************************

MSCS students must take 12 credits of other electives.

Electives can be any COMP 400 level class, except the preparation courses (COMP 400A, COMP 400B, COMP 400C, COMP 400D, COMP 400E)

General electives include any COMP 400 level course. The elective course options are common for all programs, differing only in the total number of credits required.

There are numerous options for independent study, including a programming project, research, or a service-oriented project.

.. note::

  Students may take up to a maximum of 6 credit hours of :doc:`../courses/comp490` and/or :doc:`../courses/comp499`.
