******************
Major Requirements
******************

The following two (2) courses are required by the program:

* :doc:`../courses/comp417`
* :doc:`../courses/comp460`

.. important::

    :doc:`../courses/comp460` has the prereq :doc:`../courses/comp363`.

Either class above can be substituted with another graduate course under the discretion of GPD if students had their equivalent in their undergraduate program.

Major Electives
***************

MSCS students must take four (4) courses from their concentration, and four (4) courses of general electives.

.. important::

  If a student does not puruse a specific concentration, the student must take four (4) courses from list the *Default Concentration* list of electives.

.. important::

    Several of these courses require :doc:`../courses/comp413` as a prerequisite.

There are numerous options for independent study, including a programming project, research, or a service-oriented project.

.. note::

  Students may take up to a maximum of 6 credit hours of :doc:`../courses/comp490` and/or :doc:`../courses/comp499`.
