.. note::

  If you declared your major prior to Fall 2021, please follow the :doc:`msit_old` page.

********
Overview
********

The Master of Science in Information Technology is designed for current and aspiring professionals in charge of developing, implementing, operating, and managing information systems in a variety of organizations.

Students in this program will gain a broad technical understanding of current and emerging technologies in the industry, familiarity with systems engineering concepts, and a solid foundation in net-centric computing. They will also have a firm grasp of current and future effects of the convergence of the telecommunications, media, and information technology sectors.

Courses may be taken in person or online.

Entirely Online Option
======================

The program can now be completed entirely online with some decrease in available electives. Networking and security tracks may be completed online and full-time. The management tracks can be completed online at least part-time over two years. Students taking mostly regular face-to-face courses are also welcomed into online courses when they find that convenient, but students signed up explicitly for the entirely online option get the advantage of being able to be registered before other students who might happen to choose to take some of their courses online. Student in the entire online program should contact the GPD with course choices **three days** before the usual start of registration.

**********
Curriculum
**********

Most students complete the program full-time, taking mostly face-to-face courses.

* Each program requires a total of 30 credit hours
  * Generally 10 three-credit courses
* Students can receive up to 6 credit hours (replacing two of our courses) for graduate work taken elsewhere
  * See the `transfer credit section of the Graduate Student Handbook <https://graduatehandbook.cs.luc.edu/regulations.html#transfer-credit>`_ for details.

.. important::

  Students who have taken undergraduate Loyola classes:

  Many 400-level courses in the department have closely related 300-level analogues, e.g. :doc:`../courses/comp443` and :doc:`../courses/comp343`. Students who enter the MS program after taking a Loyola course in this category must choose to take 400-level courses that are not closely related to any 300-level courses taken earlier, unless they have GPD permission.

Overall, to achieve depth and breadth, Information Technology students must complete the following:

* One (1) required course addressing ethical and social issues in the computing field.
* Three (3) courses within *one* of the following tracks:
  * Enterprise Information Management
  * Technology Management
  * Information Assurance
  * Enterprise Networking.
* Six (6) courses or 18 credits that do not need to be on any track (electives). These electives can be any 400-level course offered by the department, with approval by your advisor.

The courses listed below can be counted toward the different tracks. Any other COMP course (400 level or higher) can count as an elective towards the required 30 credits. Special permission is required to count any other course as a track requirement or as an elective.

.. note::
     You only need three courses in one track. There is no need to satisfy more than one track.

Major Prerequisites
===================

* A four-year undergraduate degree in **any field**

Preperation Courses
===================

Major Requirements (3 credits)
==============================

* :doc:`../courses/comp417`

The class above can be substituted with another graduate course under the discretion of GPD if students had their equivalent in their undergraduate program.

General Electives (18 Credits)
==============================

The elective course options are common for all programs,
differing only in the total number of credits required.

Electives can be any COMP 400 level class.

There are numerous options for independent study,
including a programming project, research, or a service-oriented project.

.. note::

  Students may take up to a maximum of 6 credit hours of :doc:`../courses/comp490` and/or :doc:`../courses/comp499`.
