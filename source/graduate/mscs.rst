Overview
********

The M.S. in Computer Science provides foundations of Computer Science while acknowledging that Computer Science is key to algorithms in the sciences. Other programs in the Computer Science Department with different foci are :doc:`msit` and the :doc:`msse`.

The M.S. in Computer Science offers the following concentrations of specialization:

STEM Designation
****************

With a national shortage of professionals trained in STEM-related fields, employers are actively pursuing STEM degree holders. Distinguish yourself in technology with a STEM-designated degree.

The MS in Computer Science has been granted a STEM designation from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The program achieved STEM designation because of its emphasis on teaching students how to solve computer science problems with a suite of quantitative and technological tools.

Under this STEM classification, international students can extend their training in the U.S. by working in their field of study. Students can qualify for a 24-month OPT (Optional Practical Training) Extension, bringing the total OPT time granted to 36 months.

**********
Curriculum
**********

* Each program requires a total of 30 credit hours

  * Generally 10 three-credit courses

* Students can receive up to 6 credit hours (replacing two of our courses) for graduate work taken elsewhere

  * See the `transfer credit section of the Graduate Student Handbook <https://graduatehandbook.cs.luc.edu/policy/regulations.html#transfer-credit>`_ for details.

.. important::

  Students who have taken undergraduate Loyola classes:

  Many 400-level courses in the department have closely related 300-level analogues, e.g. :doc:`../courses/comp443` and :doc:`../courses/comp343`. Students who enter the MS program after taking a Loyola course in this category must choose to take 400-level courses that are not closely related to any 300-level courses taken earlier, unless they have GPD permission.

.. warning::

    The Computer Science Program has more prerequisites than other programs.

Overall, to achieve depth and breadth, Computer Science students must complete the following to obtain the required 30 credits to graduate:

* Two (2) required courses (6 credit hours)
* Four (4) electives restricted to a concentration (12 credit hours)
* Four (4) general electives (12 credit hours)

Major Prerequisites
===================

A four-year undergraduate degree in any field. Computer science, software engineering, computer engineering, or related background highly recommended. For students without a programming or related background, see below the preparation courses that you have to take.

.. _prep:

Prerequisite/Preparation Courses
--------------------------------

All of these courses must be taken if you do not have a four-year undergraduate degree in a related field.

* :doc:`../courses/comp400a`
* :doc:`../courses/comp400b`
* :doc:`../courses/comp400c`
* :doc:`../courses/comp400d`
* :doc:`../courses/comp400e`

.. warning::

  Students may not use an introductory course to satisfy a foundation or elective requirement.

  Preparatory courses do not count towards the 30 required credit hours of non-preparatory courses.

A student taking any necessary preparation course is considered to be a full-fledged student of the Graduate School. Preparation courses may be taken in the same semester as other graduate courses, provided the prerequisites for the other graduate courses are met. Students are expected, however, to take all necessary preparation courses early in their career.

A student may place out of an introductory course under any of the following conditions:

* The student has appropriate coursework equivalent to the introductory course.
* The student has appropriate and verified professional experience equivalent to the introductory course.
* The student passes a Graduate Competency Assessment (GCA) in the introductory course area.
* This can be waived under the discretion of the GPD.

If a student has had a preparatory course waived, departmental assistance will usually be necessary to allow the student to register for any other course having that preparatory course as a prerequisite.
