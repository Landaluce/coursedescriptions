About
=====

.. warning::
    This class cannot be used towards the degree requirements for the MS programs. This class is intended as a preparatory course for graduate students without prior programming experience

This course introduces more advanced data structures such as priority queues, heaps, balanced trees,  B trees and graphs, as well as their implementations. Performance and analysis of algorithms are covered along with applications in sorting and searching.

Description
===========

This course explores advanced abstract data structures in depth, such as sets, maps, and graphs, and reproduces their implementation using arrays and dynamically allocated nodes in an object-oriented language. The course also analyzes the performance of the data structuresâ€™ built-in operations and related algorithms such as sorting, searching, and traversing.

Outcome
=======

Students learn non-linear data structures and runtime performance of their operations, solve computational problems by choosing suitable data structures and implement algorithms within the object-oriented paradigm
