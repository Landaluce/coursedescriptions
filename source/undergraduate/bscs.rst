    Undergraduate Degree
    B.S. in Computer Science

B.S. in Computer Science
=========================

Overview
---------

The B.S. degree program in computer science provides a balance between theoretical foundations and applied computer science with the ultimate goal of presenting knowledge likely to be of ongoing value throughout one's career. The preparation of the B.S. is aimed at students who want to pursue a career as an industry practitioner and/or as an academic.

Among the 25 occupation groups of The Bureau of Labor Statistics, Computer and Information Technology is rated second highest in median pay and fourth highest in projected employment growth for the period 2014 to 2024.

- 4 credits of COMP 3xx

.. note::

    With permission, extra credits of |math161|, |math162|, or 300 level `MATH <https://www.luc.edu/math/course-catalog.shtml#146751>`_, `PHYS <https://www.luc.edu/physics/courses.shtml#95720>`_, or `STAT <https://www.luc.edu/math/course-catalog.shtml#146752>`_ **for double majors** can be applied in this category.)

General Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Credits never can be double-counted for different categories of the requirements for the major. But a course may satisfy a major requirement and also satisfy a University and/or College requirement (e.g., Core, residency, Engaged Learning, Writing Intensive).

- It is usually not meant to combine a computing major or minor with another, the principal exception being CCFR-MINR; see more detail in the `double-dipping rules <https://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/undergraduateprograms/double-dippingrules>`_.
