Minor in Information Technology
===============================

Overview
--------

If you declared the minor before Fall 2020, you may use the old Minor in Information Technology curriculum (:doc:`minoritold`).

This minor is designed for students seeking understanding of important aspects of computing such as databases, networking, and/or security, especially from a managerial viewpoint. This may be a particularly valuable enhancement to a major in the School of Business as well as to majors in other fields in the College of Arts and Sciences or other divisions of the University..


Curriculum
----------

Eighteen (18) total credits (or 21 if taking ACCT201 and MGMT201):

-   :doc:`../courses/comp170`

-   One of :doc:`../courses/comp306`, :doc:`../courses/comp305`, :doc:`../courses/comp353`, :doc:`../courses/comp343`.
-   Two more courses from the 200-level and 300-level courses listed above. One of these courses can be replaced by ACCT201 and MGMT201.
