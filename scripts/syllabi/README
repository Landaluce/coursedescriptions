These scripts will be used to create the CSV tables for syllabi.
Data are exported from a Google/Excel spreadsheet.

Assuming you have courses.csv (or any .csv):

```
sqlite3 courses.db
sqlite> .mode csv
sqlite> .load courses.csv
sqlite> ^d
```

The Jupyter notebook shows how to take this output and make
the CSV table we use for the syllabi pages

We let the database do most heavy lifting for aggregating by
course/section number and creating a proper Sphinx URL.

I'll be working on getting the Jupyter notebook into a proper
script so we can integrate all of this with our CI workflow (via
Travis).
