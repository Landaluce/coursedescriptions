Machine Learning



Prerequisite: COMP 271



Machine learning is the process of making predictions and decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. Topics include a variety of supervised
learning methods. Ensemble approaches are used to combine independent models efficiently. Unsupervised and semi-supervised methods demonstrate the power of
learning from data without an explicit training goal.

"DevOps: Methods, Tools & Practices
"


Prerequisite: COMP 271



This course is an introduction on how to think and work as a DevOps Engineer. DevOps takes its name from Development (Software Engineering) and Operations
"(IT Systems/Operations Management), with the addition of a Quality Assurance dimension. In the course students will develop a product, test and analyze"
"their code, package, deploy, and monitor the systems their code runs on. Learning about the systems that code will be running on and minimizing any risk"
factors during the deployment and upgrading process is critical in order to keep any business up and running. Knowing the whole pipeline from engineering to
deployment and maintenance will give any student an edge a broader picture of how new industries work.

"DevOps: Methods, Tools & Practices
"


Prerequisite: COMP 271



This course is an introduction on how to think and work as a DevOps Engineer. DevOps takes its name from Development (Software Engineering) and Operations
"(IT Systems/Operations Management), with the addition of a Quality Assurance dimension. In the course students will develop a product, test and analyze"
"their code, package, deploy, and monitor the systems their code runs on. Learning about the systems that code will be running on and minimizing any risk"
factors during the deployment and upgrading process is critical in order to keep any business up and running. Knowing the whole pipeline from engineering to
deployment and maintenance will give any student an edge a broader picture of how new industries work.
